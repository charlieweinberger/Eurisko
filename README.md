This GitHub repository is an amalgamation of all the code I wrote for the [Eurisko](https://www.eurisko.us/) program at Pasadena High School. Originally in several individual repositories, I've retroactively combined and sorted all programs into this one repo. These programs includes everything from introductory C++/Haskell, to fundamental machine learning algorithms, to AI agents build to play games like tic-tac-toe and checkers.
