This GitHub repository is an amalgamation of all the code I wrote for the [Eurisko](https://www.eurisko.us/) program at Pasadena High School. Originally in several individual repositories, I've retroactively combined and sorted all programs into this one repo. This repo includes topics such as introductory C++/Haskell, classic data structures and algorithms, fundamental machine learning techniques, and even custom AI game-playing agents for tic-tac-toe, checkers, and [Space Empires](https://github.com/eurisko-us/space-empires-js-cohort-2-gitpod).
