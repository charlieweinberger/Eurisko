"""
The rref method of computing a determinant is much faster than the cofacter method. The rref method took less than a second, while the cofactor method took over two minutes, according to my timer. I would guess that this is because of the recursion if the cofactor method. To compute a 10 by 10 matrix, it has to compute 10 9 by 9 matrices, which means it has to compute 90 8 by 8 matrices, and so on. In the end, it has to compute 10!/2 (which equals 1,814,400) 2 by 2 matrices.
