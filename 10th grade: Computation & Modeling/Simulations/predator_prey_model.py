- Initially, there are 100 deer and 10 wolves.

- In the absence of wolves, the deer population would increase at the instantaneous rate of 60% per year.

- In the absence of deer, the wolf population would decrease at the instantaneous rate of 90% per year.

- The wolves and deer meet at an instantaneous rate of 0.05 times per wolf per deer per year, and every time a wolf meets a deer, it kills and eats the deer.

- The rate at which the wolf population increases is proportional to the number of deer that are killed, by a factor of 0.4. In other words, the wolf population grows by a rate of 0.4 wolves per deer killed per year.

Check your answer: at t = 0, you should have dD/dt = 10 and dW/dt = 11.
