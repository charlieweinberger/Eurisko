- There are initially 1000 susceptible people and 1 infected person.

- The number of meetings between susceptible and infected people each day is proportional to the product of the numbers of susceptible and infected people, by a factor of 0.01. The transmission rate of the disease is 3%. (In other words, 3% of meetings result in transmission.)

- Each day, 2% of infected people recover.

Check: If you've written the system correctly, then at t=0, you should have dS/dt = -0.3, dI/dt = 0.28, dR/dt = 0.02.
